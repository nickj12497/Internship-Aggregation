The Codecademy lessons are the first step to the process; they are web classes meant to teach the fundamentals of coding and code syntax. After completing these lessons, you will start on your very first web app called a TodoMVC. TodoMVCs are "To Do" lists coded in a "Model, View, Controller" fashion. The next step will be to make TodoMVCs using the coding languages AngularJS, MithrilJS, and a CoffeeScript. Finally, the fully-fledged TodoMVC, which consists of Firebase, Gulp, Webpack, and GitHub, creates more of a challenge but will be more rewarding and have greater functionality.

##Codecademy Lessons
(The order of the lessons is only a recommendation)

1. [Ruby](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby)
2. [JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)
3. [HTML/CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)
4. [Angular JS](http://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-angularjs)

##AngularJS, MithrilJS, and CoffeeScript

###Create TodoMVCs using:

1. [Angular JavaScript](https://angularjs.org/)
2. [Mithril JavaScript](https://lhorie.github.io/mithril/)
3. [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)(compiled to Javascript)

##Write and Deploy a TodoMVC using:

1. [git](http://www.git-scm.com) as the version control system
2. [GitHub](http://www.github.com) as the source code repository
3. [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) as the main programming language
4. [Vue.js](http://www.vuejs.org) as the MVC framework
5. [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com) as the persistent data store
6. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [Webpack](http://www.webpack.github.io) as the build tools
